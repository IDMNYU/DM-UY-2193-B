    * code-along: animating a cat
    
### Next Week:

* Jquery and Final Project Workshop

### Homework:

1. Display an image of an animal on your HTML page

2. You are going to now use JS DOM manipulation do "decorate" that animal. The decoration should be triggered by some type of user event. However you decorate the animal is up to you! You can draw on it, put a hat on it, make it wear makeup, etc.

One idea:

1. When the user moves the mouse, create a new div with a background color, and append it to the page. 
2. Position it using CSS absolute positioning, according to the user's mouse position.
3. Bonus: Make it different colors depending where you paint, make it random colors, or add a paint color dropdown selector on the side.

 
OR:

Include an image of a hat or a moustache or something else silly that your pet might want to wear. Allow the user to click on the animal and have that click move the object to that position on the pet.

Push this code to Github Pages and submit the link to your live page and source code under Assignment #8.
