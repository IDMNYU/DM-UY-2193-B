### Exercise: 

Set up a simple HTML page that includes 4 content blocks: header, footer, and two blocks of your choosing in between. 

Use CSS to fill in these blocks with a background color so they are visible.

Use CSS grid to adjust the size of these blocks so the header fills the top of the page, the bottom fills the bottom of the page, and your two other content blocks are adjusted accordingly inside of the grid container between the header and footer.

### Homework

* Build one webpage that includes a grid. This grid can include any content: images, colors, text, etc. You will be creating the grid two times.
    
    * For the first iteration, use Bootstrap 
    
    * For the second iteration, use CSS Grid
