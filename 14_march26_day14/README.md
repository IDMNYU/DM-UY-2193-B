## Day 14

Welcome back!

* Learning Logs: Junjie & Loki

* Intro to Bootstrap!

* Bootstrap in-class assignment

This assignment will begin in class with a partner. Please work with your partner on one machine during class and include both students' names on your project folder. Each student will need their own submission for this assignment, so please share your files with each other at the end of class.

You and your partner should pick a topic to create a new website around. You do not need to include a lot of content, but it does need to be cohesive.

*Getting Started*

    * Make a new project folder called bootstrap where you will put all your website files for this assignment. 

    * Follow instructions for getting started with Bootstrap. This is simply a matter of linking to the files that Bootstrap depends on. You can choose to download Bootstrap or simply link to the CDN. (I recommend linking to the CDN.)

    * Create an index.html file.

    * Copy and paste the HTML source code for the Bootstrap starter template, and save it into your own HTML file named “index.html” in your project folder
    
    * Make sure you have a link to the Bootstrap core CSS in the head.

    * You will also be creating a custom stylesheet, which you will link to below the Bootstrap CSS.

    * Open the HTML page you made in your web browser. Make sure it looks just like the starter template example before proceeding.

*Leveraging Bootstrap’s Features* 

Familiarize yourself with the various aspects of working with Bootstrap, including the following:

    * The built-in CSS classes that can be used to create custom layouts, including grid-based layouts with responsive layouts features

    * The built-in CSS classes that can be used to style common user interface components, such as buttons, glyphs, drop-down menus, and thumbnail images
    
    * The built-in CSS classes that can be used to create interactive widgets, such as carousels, tabs, and drop-down menus

    * For each element you want to customize, find its code in the compiled Bootstrap CSS

    * Copy the component's selector and styles and paste them in your custom stylesheet. For instance, to customize the navbar background, just copy the .navbar style specification.

    * In your custom stylesheet, edit the CSS you just copied from the Bootstrap source.
    
    * Continue this process until you’re happy with your customizations.

*Requirements*

Here is a list of required elements to include:

    * Create the general page layout on each page using Bootstrap’s resposive grid layout features

    * Use a Bootstrap navigation component 
    
    * Use Bootstrap’s carousel widget, including at least three images
    
    * Incorporate at least one Bootstrap component (such as buttons, glyphs, drop-down menus, etc.) on each page of the site
    
    * Beyond these requirements, feel free to explore Bootstrap and take this project as far as you would like! Sites that demonstrate extra effort and thoughtfulness will be considered for extra credit. In particular, try to customize your website so that it does not look like Bootstrap’s default themes.
    
    * Add this project folder to the main repository connected to Github pages, and push your code so that it is live at username.github.io/bootstrap
    
    * Submit the link to your source code on Github and your link to Github pages on NYU Classes under In-Class Assignment: Bootstrap.
    
### Homework

* FINISH YOUR MIDTERM! 

    * Midterm project is open on NYU Classes. Make sure you are clear on all submission requirements. Check and double check your work before submitting.
    
    * Do learning logs and schedule office hours if you are stuck!
    
    * Thursday our classroom will be open for you to workshop your midterms if you need. Attendance is optional.
    
    * On Tuesday, April 2, come to class with your midterm project completed. You will only need to present your live website and source code.
    
* Reminder: Midterm grades will be turned in the first week of April, so make sure your homework is up to date!
