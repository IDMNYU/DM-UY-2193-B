## Day 15

*Midterm Presentation Day!*

Peer Review Format:

* Designate a note taker for each member of your group. They will be responsible for sending peer feedback via Slack.

* First demonstrate and show, then walk through how you built the site. 

* Allow time for each member of your group to navigate the site on their own.

* When feedback is being offered, allow each person to speak without interruption. You are to simply receive the information.

* Allow a couple of minutes for questions at the end of each project.

Peer Review Framework:

* Is the concept evident? Is it clear what this site is about? If so, why? If not, why not?

* Is the site well organized? Does the layout and navigation make sense? If so, why? If not, why not?

* Has attention been paid to spelling, alignment, image preparation/resolution?

* What are the strongest elements? What would you recommend to strengthen the site?

### Homework

* Remember to catch up on any missing work before midterm grades are submitted on Friday.
