  * A DOCTYPE tag
  
  * An html tag
  
  * A head
  
  * A body
  
  * In the body, add a large heading that acts as a headline that declares your favorite restaurant
  
  * Below this large heading, add a smaller, sub-heading that tells the user a bold statement about this restaurant
  
  * Include *sensational* paragraph text that tells a fictional 3-4 sentence story about this restaurant.
