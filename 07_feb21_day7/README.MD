[HTML Shell](http://htmlshell.com/), HTML Skeleton (Brackets), HTML Boilerplate (Sublime), [Atom-html-template](https://atom.io/packages/atom-html-templates)


### Homework

* Push Assignment #3 to Github + Github Pages, and submit both a link to the source code on Github and a link to the live page on Github pages on NYU Classes under Assignment #3.2

* Review Git/Github, and make sure you are clear on how to initialize, stage, commit, and push files to your Github repo. If anything here is confusing, this could make a GREAT learning log! If anything is still not working, then please make an appointment for office hours.

* Read [The Difference Between ID and Class](https://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-id-and-class/)

* Complete a Learning Log if you haven't already! Suggestions for this week:
