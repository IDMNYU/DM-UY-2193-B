### Homework

* You are going to create a new project with three pages. You can decide on the content, but make it be coherent (no placeholder content). Your site should include the following:

    * An external CSS stylesheet
    
    * Three HTML files
    
    * A navigation bar that links all three pages together. Think about your navigation on each page.
    
    * Your home page should include:
    
        * At least one image
        
        * An iframe tag
        
        * One link with an absolute pathway
        
        * At least one logical semantic tag
        
        * The use of at least one id
        
        * At least 2 instances of a class
        
    * Your other 2 pages do not need extensive content, but there should be some basic content to view. Use your stylesheet to apply style to all 3 pages.
